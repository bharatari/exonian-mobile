# Exonian Mobile
A prototype version of The Exonian mobile app built for The Exonian student newspaper at Phillips Exeter Academy. Exonian Mobile is a cross-platform hybrid moble app built on the Ionic Framework. This version of the app was originally intended to be published as the official The Exonian mobile app, however, due to limitations with Mobile Safari and performance issues with Ionic on Android this version of the app was succeeded by a new version built on React Native.
