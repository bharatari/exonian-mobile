# Exonian Mobile
A prototype version of The Exonian mobile app built on the cross-platform Ionic Framework. This version of the app was originally intended to be published as the official Exonian mobile app, however, due to limitations with Mobile Safari and performance issues with Ionic on Android this version of the app was succeeded by a new version built on React Native.
